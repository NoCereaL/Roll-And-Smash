# Roll-And-Smash
 - Snowball game     - Starts of as a small snowball     - A snowball rolling down the hill and gradually gets bigger the more snow is picked up and accumulated.     - Try and stay on snow to grow bigger or it shrinks if you go on grass, sand or tarmac.      - Get the ball as big as possible and smash into standing snow balls/piles or snowmen, if you are big enough to not be consumed by them.     - Reach the end to take out as many people as possible with the snowball.     - POSSIBILITY: make the game like aquapark.io where you can fall down and get to the end quicker.         - Pick up as much snow/product to increase your size.         - IF you feel like you have enough to take out all the rag dolls at the end             - Then take a short cut and hit them head on or skip parts of the track to get to the end quicker.         - Else complete the track normally and get to the end.             - Get as much product as possible to increase size, take out standing ragdolls that are on the track,             - You can either take out the ones on the track so you have less to takeout at the end/bottom.             - Or you could completely avoid the ragdolls on the track/ take out the smaller ones and get as big as possible to take out as many as possible at the bottom         - *ALTERNATIVELY*: The depth is picking either strategy to complete level.
